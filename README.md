# twitch_multiban
Multibantool for twitch (e.g. followbots). Just execute the file and go through the wizard.

# Usage
Just execute the .exe file. The wizard will guide you through the needed input from your side.
I'd recommend to put the .exe in a seperate directory.

## Important information
Take care of the rates mentioned in the wizard. If you exceed these rates you may get temporarily banned from the twitch chat.

Also remember: One user per line in the banlist.txt

# Self compiling
```
pip install pyinstaller

python -m PyInstaller --onefile pybantool.py
```
